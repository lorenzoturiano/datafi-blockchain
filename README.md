# **DataFi — Decentralized Data Network for AI Training**

**DataFi** is a blockchain-based ecosystem designed to solve one of today’s biggest AI challenges: access to high-quality, transparent, and privacy-preserving training data. The project proposes a decentralized marketplace where datasets are verifiable, usage is traceable, and contributors are fairly rewarded through tokenized incentives.


Built on Ethereum Layer-2 and powered by the **$DATA** token, DataFi combines on-chain provenance, automated licensing, federated learning, and decentralized storage to create a trustworthy and compliant data infrastructure for the AI era.

This repository contains the full project report, including:

* The problem and market opportunity
* The DataFi architecture and workflow
* Token economics and governance model
* Business model, roadmap, and funding plan
